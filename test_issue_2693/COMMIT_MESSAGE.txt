queue: add validation for maxDiskSpace vs maxFileSize relationship

Add validation in qqueueCorrectParams() to ensure that queue.maxDiskSpace
is not smaller than queue.maxfilesize. This prevents the shutdown loop
described in issue #2693 where rsyslog fails to shutdown properly when
individual queue files can be larger than the total allowed disk space.

The validation:
- Only applies to disk queues (when pszFilePrefix is set)
- Only validates when both parameters are explicitly set
- Provides a clear error message explaining the problem and suggesting solutions
- Follows existing patterns for queue parameter validation

This fix prevents users from creating configurations that would cause
shutdown problems and provides clear guidance on how to fix invalid
configurations.
