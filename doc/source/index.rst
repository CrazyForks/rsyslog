rsyslog
=======

**rsyslog** is a high-performance, modular logging framework designed for
both traditional syslog workloads and modern log processing pipelines. It
supports flexible routing, advanced filtering, structured logging, and
integrations with modern observability tools such as **Elasticsearch,
Kafka, and cloud-based systems**.

rsyslog is widely used as the default logging daemon on Linux systems and
scales from embedded environments to large enterprise deployments. Its
modular design enables you to collect, transform, and reliably deliver
logs to a wide variety of destinations.
