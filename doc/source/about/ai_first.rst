AI-First: Our Vision for rsyslog
================================

Rsyslog’s AI-First strategy is our commitment to embedding AI as a core
enabling technology in every part of the project's lifecycle. It is not
limited to documentation — it is a comprehensive vision that redefines how
the project evolves, from the initial idea to design, development, testing,
and user support. Just as Wikipedia revolutionized knowledge access compared
to traditional encyclopedias, we believe AI will reshape how users interact
with and manage logging systems.

**As of this writing in 2025**, current AI models are rapidly evolving, and
achieving fully precise answers in all complex logging scenarios remains a
long-term vision. This journey will likely take **5 to 10 years** to fully
mature. What we are building today are the essential building blocks for that
future.

A Personal Word from the Lead Developer Rainer Gerhards
-------------------------------------------------------
I have seen and contributed to major technological shifts over decades — from
early datacenter systems in the 1980s to the rise of the internet, PCs, and
modern IT security practices. With rsyslog, I see AI as the next transformative
leap. We are not chasing trends; we are preparing for a future where **AI
becomes an integral layer in the entire software lifecycle**.

We actively use AI not only to assist with documentation but also to generate
code. Every output is carefully reviewed and validated by maintainers. By
consistently challenging AI with complex edge cases, we learn how far current
models can go and improve both our prompts and our code. This process not only
makes AI more effective but also **improves our own code to make it more
suitable for AI-assisted generation**.

For more background on my vision and how it connects to rsyslog, see my article:
`The Vision Behind rsyslog's AI-First Strategy <https://rainer.gerhards.net/2025/07/ai-first-rsyslog-reshaping-development-docs-and-support.html>`_.

Why AI-First?
-------------
- **Users demand instant answers.** AI enables concise, context-relevant
  responses instead of overwhelming pages of content.
- **Amplifying expertise.** Rsyslog embodies decades of logging know-how, but
  our resources for writing traditional docs are limited. AI multiplies our
  effectiveness.
- **Future-ready approach.** AI will inevitably shape development, support,
  and user interactions. We want to lead rather than follow.

Our Vision
----------
AI-First means embedding AI into **every stage of the rsyslog lifecycle**:

- **Idea & Design** – AI assists in refining proposals, analyzing requirements,
  and evaluating architectural choices. For example, AI can help analyze
  community feature requests to identify common patterns and prioritize
  development.
- **Development & Testing** – AI supports code analysis, generates test cases,
  and assists in reviewing complex logic. This is especially powerful for
  creating exhaustive tests for obscure edge cases that are time-consuming to
  write manually.
- **Documentation & Knowledge** – AI helps restructure and clarify
  information, making it accessible both to humans and machine learning
  models.
- **User Support** – Tools like the `rsyslog Assistant <https://rsyslog.ai>`_
  deliver immediate, context-aware guidance.

Addressing AI Criticism
-----------------------
We are aware of skepticism in the open-source community regarding AI. Here’s
our position:

- **AI augments humans, not replaces them.** All AI outputs are reviewed and
  verified by core maintainers.
- **Transparency and trust.** We disclose where AI is involved and ensure
  quality through careful oversight.
- **Quality remains paramount.** AI offloads repetitive tasks so maintainers
  can focus on innovation and critical problem-solving.

Key Principles
--------------
- **Human-in-Control** – AI suggestions are never blindly accepted; experts
  make final decisions.
- **Continuous Improvement** – We adapt as AI models evolve, integrating new
  tools while maintaining high standards.
- **Openness** – Our AI-First strategy is open and documented for the
  community to see.

What’s Next?
------------
- Advancing AI-powered **log analysis and observability** tools.
- Iterative improvements in documentation, examples, and user onboarding.
- Expanding the capabilities of the rsyslog Assistant and related support
  systems.

Looking Forward
---------------
AI-First is not a shortcut. It is **a strategic investment** in the future of
rsyslog. We are combining code, documentation, support, and AI into a connected
lifecycle to provide **fast, accurate, and reliable answers** to users. This
AI-driven evolution complements our unwavering commitment to the core
principles that have always defined rsyslog: rock-solid reliability, high
performance, and meticulous engineering. The journey is long, but we are
committed to achieving this vision.
