AI First – What It Really Means
===============================

Rsyslog’s **AI First** approach means that AI technology is embedded into
all aspects of the project — from development and documentation to user
education, support, and deployment guidance. AI is not replacing humans;
it is **guided, reviewed, and controlled by experts**, ensuring quality
and reliability at every step.

Our goal is to combine **decades of hands-on logging expertise** with
modern AI tools to create a faster, more responsive, and user-friendly
experience — without sacrificing correctness or depth.

What AI First Means
-------------------

- **Documentation Overhaul** – AI-assisted restructuring and rewriting,
  making the content clearer and easier to navigate.
- **Developer Productivity** – AI helps with code analysis, test coverage,
  and initial drafts for complex refactorings — always reviewed by
  maintainers.
- **User Education** – Tutorials, guides, and onboarding materials are
  being improved with AI support, focusing on real-world tasks and
  common pitfalls.
- **Community Engagement** – AI-powered assistance via the 
  `rsyslog Assistant <https://rsyslog.ai>`_ makes expert knowledge 
  accessible in seconds. *Try the rsyslog Assistant now to get immediate
  configuration tips and troubleshooting help.*

Key Principles
--------------

- **Human-in-Control** – AI outputs are always reviewed by core developers
  and contributors. We don’t do “vibe coding” or fully autonomous content
  generation.
- **Continuous Improvement** – As AI models evolve, we expect to delegate
  more routine tasks, but critical design and quality decisions remain
  human-driven.
- **Openness** – AI is used transparently, with a focus on enhancing user
  experience and project maintainability.

What’s Next?
------------

- More AI-powered tools for **log analysis and observability** built into
  future releases.
- Expansion of the **Beginners’ Guide**, which is still in its early stage.
- Continuous revision of legacy documentation and examples.
